Javascript
============
q)What are the differences between Java and Javascript?
ans)

Java						Javascript
----						-----------
Java is not a scripting language.		Javascript is a scripting language.
						(we don't need to compile the program).

Java can run individually.			Javascript can't run individually.

Java is a object oriented language.		Javascript is a object based language.	
(class,object,inheritence,polymorphism and      (we can predefine objects).
etc.)

Java does not required Browser for execution.	Javascript required Browser for execution.

Java is a strongly typed checking language.	Javascript is a loosely typed checking language.

Java is a complex language.			Javascript is a simple language.

What is Javascript?
=====================
Javascript is a loosely typed checking language.

Original name of javascript is called LiveScript which completed development by 
using c language syntax's.

LiveScript is developed by Netscape Corporation in 1990's.

In 1995, Brendan Eich popular scientist from Netscape Corporation rename LiveScript
to JavaScript. 

If we see the syntax of Javascript ,we can find similar to c language syntax's.

Javascript Official name is ECMA script.

Here ECMA means European computer Manufacturer's Association.

Features of JavaScript
=======================
Javascript is a case sensitive language.

Javascript is used to create interactive web sites.

JavaScript executes at client side i.e Browser window.

Javascript is used for client-side validation.

Javascript supports Drop-Down Menu.

Javascript makes our web page responsive(Dynamic).

Javascript display pop-up windows and dialog boxes.

Javscript creates cookies.

Javascript supports objects.

Javscript allows to hadle Date and Time.

syntax of Javascript
======================
syntax1
-------
	<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">
	stmt1;
	stmt2;
	stmt3;
	</script>

syntax2
-------
	<script>
	stmt1
	stmt2
	stmt3
	</script>
	Here type and language attribute is optional to declare.
	Here semicolon is optional because javascript is a loosely typed checking language.

example1
--------
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
			<title>MyPage</title>
			<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">
					document.write("Welcome To JavaScript");
			</script>
	</head>
	<body>
	</body>
</html>

We have to save above program with ".html" or ".htm" extension because it 
contains html code and javascript code.

If a file contains only javascript code then we need to save that file with
".js" extension.

ex:2
----
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
			<title>MyPage</title>
			<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">
					document.writeln("Welcome To JavaScript");
					
					document.write('Welcome To GlobalEdx');
			</script>
	</head>
	<body>
	</body>
</html>

Here document.writeln() method is used to provide a space.

ex:3
----
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
			<title>MyPage</title>
			
	</head>
	<body>
			<pre>
			<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">
					document.writeln("Welcome To JavaScript");
					
					document.writeln('Welcome To GlobalEdx');
			</script>
			</pre>
	</body>
</html>
<pre> tag is used to display pre formatted text.

ex:4
-----
To provide new line we can use <br> tag.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
			<title>MyPage</title>
			
	</head>
	<body>
			
			<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">
					document.writeln("Welcome To JavaScript");
					<br>
					document.writeln('Welcome To GlobalEdx');
			</script>
	</body>
</html>

Here output will not be displayed because a <br> tag must not be used in 
scripting environment area.

In generally, we can't use Markup language inside scripting language.

To use markup language inside scripting language we need to do following.

ex:5
----
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
			<title>MyPage</title>
			
	</head>
	<body>
			
			<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">
					document.writeln("Welcome To JavaScript");
					document.writeln("<br>");
					document.writeln('Welcome To GlobalEdx');
			</script>
	</body>
</html>

ex:6
---
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
			<title>MyPage</title>
			
	</head>
	<body>
			
			<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">
					document.writeln("Welcome To JavaScript <br/>");
					document.writeln('Welcome To GlobalEdxxx');
			</script>
	</body>
</html>

Note:
----
	It is also possible to implement Html tags in Javascript.

ex:7
----
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
			<title>MyPage</title>
			
	</head>
	<body>
			
			<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">
					document.writeln("<h1>Welcome To JavaScript</h1><br/>");
					document.writeln('<b><i><center>Welcome To GlobalEdxxx</center></i></b>');
			</script>
	</body>
</html>

ex:8
----
Any program which contains html,css and javascript code then combinedly it is 
called DHTML(Dynamic Hypertext Markup Language).

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
			<title>MyPage</title>
			
	</head>
	<body>
			
			<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">
					document.writeln("<h1>Welcome To JavaScript</h1><br/>");
					document.writeln('<b style="color:red;font-size:30px;background-color:cyan;">Welcome To GlobalEdxxx</b>');
			</script>
	</body>
</html>


Note:
-----
	DHTML is a term where group of terminologies we used.

Types of Javascript
======================
We have two types of Javascript.

1)Internal JavaScript / Embedded JavaScript

2)External JavaScript / Seperate JavaScript


1)Internal JavaScript
---------------------
Both html and javascript code will be written in the same file with .html 
extension is called Internal JavaScript.

Advantages
----------
	Easy to understand.

	No Confusion of multiple files.

Disadvantage
---------------
	If the code size is increases then it will increase developer confusion
	also.

conclusion
----------
	Internal Javascript is suitable for Learning and Practiceing level.

2)External JavaScript
----------------------
External javascript contains Html code  in ".html" file and Javascript code 
in ".js" file.

In External Javascript , html code should call Javascript code internally.

Diagram: js1.1

Advantage/Merits
----------------
	Even though the code increases , the developer can understand the code
	easily.

Disadvantage/Demerits
-----------------
	Number of Files will be increases.
