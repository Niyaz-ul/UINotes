CSS syntax

A CSS rule-set consists of a selector and declaration block.
ex:

      selector
          |
	div{ color:red;font-size:40px;}
             |________________________|
 		   Declaratiob block

The selector points to the HTML Element/Tag which we want to style.

Declaratiob block consist of property name and propertyvalue seperated with colon(:).

Multiple CSS Property declarations are seperated with semicolon(;) and 
declaration block surrounded by curly braces({}).

Types of CSS and Ways to insert CSS
=====================================
We have three types of CSS.They are 

1)Inline CSS

2)Internal CSS/ Embedded CSS

3)External CSS / Seperate CSS

1)Inline CSS
--------------
Inline CSS may be used to apply a unique style for a single Element/Tag.

We can achieve inline CSS with the help of "style" attribute.

The "style" attribute may contains any CSS property.

ex:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
			<title>MyPage</title>

	</head>
	<body>
			<h1  style="color:#D980FA;text-align:center;">This Is Heading</h1>
			<p style="color:#EE5A24;font-size:40px">This is Paragraph</p>
	</body>
</html>


2)Internal CSS / Embedded CSS
---------------------------
Internal CSS may be used if one single html page has a unique style.

We can achieve internal CSS with the help <style> tag/element.

ex:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
			<title>MyPage</title>
			<style type="text/css">
				body
				{
					background-color:#ffcccc;
				}
				h1
				{
					color:red;
					font-family:tahoma;
					text-align:center;
				}
			</style>
	</head>
	<body>
			<h1>This is GlobalEdx</h1>
			<h1>This is Internal CSS</h1>
	</body>
</html>

3)External CSS / Seperate CSS
----------------------------
External CSS is used to change the look of the entire website by changing just one file.

Each html pages includes a reference to the external style sheet file inside 
the <link> tag.

Diagram : css1.1

In external css we have two create two files. i.e ".html" and ".css" file.

The external ".css" file should not contain any html tags. 

globaledx.html
-------------
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
			<title>MyPage</title>
			<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="mystyles.css">
	</head>
	<body>
			<h1>This is Heading Tag</h1>
			<p>This is Paragraph Tag</p>
	</body>
</html>

Note:
----
Here "type" attribute of <link> tag is optional.


mystyles.css
-------------
h1
{
	color:navy;
	text-align:center;
}
p
{
	color:tomato;
	font-family:arial;
}
