HTML is a case insensitive  language.

HTML elements are represented by tags so it is also known as Tag based language.

	</html>

In HTML we can't declare any Custom Tags/Userdefine Tags.

	Visual Studio Code (VSC),
	Sublime,

	Notepad (default editor).

All HTML files/documents must and should save with either ".html" or ".htm" extension only.

	anil.html
	balaji.htm

All HTML programs/documents executed on "Browser window".
ex:
	Chrome,
	Morzilla (preferable),
	Edge,
	IE (default),
